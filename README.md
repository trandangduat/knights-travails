Project: Knights Travails

🌟 Welcome to "Knight's Quest: Cake Chase"! 🌟

Embark on an adventurous journey with our feline friend, the Cake Crusader! 🐾 Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guide our cat through the enchanted chessboard streets to recover the precious piece of cake dropped on the way home from the bakery.

🕰️ But beware! Time is of the essence! You only have 5 SECONDS before the sun sets, plunging the world into darkness.

🛡️ Armed with the magical prowess of the Knight's Shortest Path Algorithm, your feline companion moves with finesse, mimicking the legendary L-shaped jumps of a chess knight. Your task is to strategize and find the quickest path to the Destination (D) from the starting point (S) while collecting the fallen cake.

🐱 Are you ready for the challenge? Put on your thinking cap and lead our perfectionist cat through the chessboard maze. The fate of the cake rests in your paws!

🎉 GOOD LUCK, HAVE FUN, and may your quest be as sweet as the missing cake! 🍰🌈
